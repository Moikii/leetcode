# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. The focus is on solving the problems correctly and also efficiently, to pass the LeetCode submission criteria.

Learing about new data-structures and algorithms, improving overall problem-solving skills, and also to show my thinking and knowledge is the goal of these challanges for me.
